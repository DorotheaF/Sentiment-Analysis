# Sentiment-Analysis
This project takes in a list of hotel reviews with POS/NEG tags and trains a set of feature weights (features like sentence length, presence of an "!", vocabulary connotation, etc.) using logistic regression. It can then use the weights to categorize unseen hotel review data. The maximum accuracy on the unseen test set was 94%.
